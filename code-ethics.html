A member of the Legislature who is an employee of, or who is the holder of less than an interest, as defined in section 1:1 of this code, in, any firm which represents, appears for, or negotiates on behalf of, any person, firm, corporation, or association with respect to any transaction between such person, firm, corporation or association and the holder of, or applicant for, a casino license, or any holding or intermediary company with respect thereto, as the same are defined in the Casino Control Act, shall, within 60 days of the adoption of this code and, thereafter, within 10 days of such representation, appearance, or negotiation, file a statement with the Joint Legislative Committee on Ethical Standards so indicating.  If such statement is properly and timely filed, such employment or holding shall not, in and of itself and without more, be considered a "personal interest" for purposes of section 2:9 of this code, although the filing of such statement shall not relieve a member of the Legislature who shall have a personal interest in any legislation from complying with the requirements of section 2:9.</p>

        <p class="codeOfEthics__text">d.   No member of the Legislature, nor any member of his immediate family, nor any partnership, firm or corporation with which he is associated as an officer, director, or holder of an interest, as defined in section 1:1 of this code, shall be an officer, director, employee, or holder of an interest, as defined in section 1:1 of this code, in any firm, corporation, or association, or holding or intermediary company with respect thereto, as the same are defined in the Casino Control Act, which is the holder of, or an applicant for, a casino license, except that a member of the immediate family of a member of the Legislature may hold employment with the holder of, or applicant for, a casino license if, in the judgment of the Joint Legislative Committee on Ethical Standards, such employment will not interfere with the responsibilities of the member of the Legislature, and will not create a conflict of interest, or reasonable risk of the public perception of a conflict of interest, on the part of the member of the Legislature.  A member of the Legislature who is the holder of less than an interest, as defined in section 1:1 of this code, in any firm, corporation, or association, or any holding or intermediary company with respect thereto, which is the holder of, or an applicant for, a casino license; or who is associated as an officer or director with any firm which is the holder of less than an interest, as defined in section 1:1 of this code, in any firm, corporation, or association, or any holding or intermediary company with respect thereto, which is the holder of, or an applicant for, a casino license; or who is an employee of any firm which is the holder of an interest or less than an interest, as defined in section 1:1 of this code, in any firm, corporation, or association, or holding or intermediary company with respect thereto, which is the holder of, or an applicant for a casino license; or who is the holder of less than an interest, as defined in section 1:1 of this code, in any firm which is the holder of an interest or less than an interest in any firm, corporation, or association, or any holding or intermediary company with respect thereto, which is the holder of, or an applicant for, a casino license; or who is the holder of an interest or less than an interest, as defined in section 1:1 of this code, in any firm which is the holder of less than an interest, as defined in section 1:1 of this code, in any firm, corporation, or association, or any holding or intermediary company with respect thereto, which is the holder of, or an applicant for, a casino license, shall, within 60 days of the adoption of this code and, thereafter, within 10 days of such association, such employment or the acquisition of such holding or the knowledge by the legislator of the acquisition of such holding, file with the Joint Legislative Committee on Ethical Standards a statement so indicating and, in the case of a holding, listing the nature and extent of such holding and date of acquisition thereof.  If such statement is properly and timely filed, such association, employment, or holding shall not, in and of itself and without more, be considered a "personal interest" for purposes of section 2:9 of this code, although the filing of such statement shall not relieve a member of the Legislature who shall have a personal interest in any legislation from complying with the requirements of section 2:9.</p>
