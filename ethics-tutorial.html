      <p class="ethicsTutorial__text njIndent">Welcome to the online legislative ethics tutorial. This interactive tutorial is designed to acquaint legislators and legislative staff with some of the major provisions governing their ethical behavior. Pursuant to N.J.S.A. 52:13D-28, all legislators and employees are required to take this tutorial no later than April 1 of every even-numbered year. Before beginning the tutorial, it is helpful to review the background of ethics regulation in the State of New Jersey.</p>

      <h3 class="ethicsTutorial__subtitle ethicsTutorial__subtitle--bar">Background</h3>

      <p class="ethicsTutorial__text njIndent">
        Standards of conduct for legislators and all State officers and employees in the executive and legislative branches 
        are delineated in the "New Jersey <a href="statutes.asp?T=COIL">Conflicts of Interest Law</a>" (N.J.S.A. 
        <a href="statutes.asp?T=COIL">52:13D-12</a> <em>et seq.).</em>  In addition, legislators and legislative officers and employees are subject to the provisions and procedural requirements of the Legislative <a href="code_ethics.asp">Code of Ethics</a>, which is adopted anew by the Legislature for each two-year session. Additionally <a href="rule19.asp">Joint Rule 19</a> of the Houses allows inquiry into any conduct of a legislator or legislative employee which reflects upon the good name, integrity, and reputation of the Legislature or any member thereof.  The New Jersey <a href="statutes.asp?T=COIL">Conflicts of Interest Law</a> and the 
        Legislative <a href="code_ethics.asp">Code of Ethics</a> regulate three classifications of persons in the Legislative branch of State government:  
        legislators; "State officers or employees" defined as full-time employees; and "special State officers or employees" 
        defined as unpaid or part-time officers or employees.  In some situations, there are different levels of restrictions 
        on each classification.  When reviewing provisions of the <a href="statutes.asp?T=COIL">Conflicts Law</a> and the <a href="code_ethics.asp">Code of Ethics</a> be sure to note whether the restrictions pertain to your classification.  While this tutorial is intended to acquaint legislators and 
        legislative staff with ethical restrictions, it is not intended to be all inclusive or to address the nuances 
        that exist in the full text of the <a href="statutes.asp?T=COIL">Conflicts of Interest Law</a> and the <a href="code_ethics.asp">Code of Ethics</a>.  Legislators and legislative employees are strongly advised to familiarize themselves with the complete provisions of the <a href="statutes.asp?T=COIL">Conflicts of Interest Law</a>, the <a href="code_ethics.asp">Code of Ethics</a> and <a href="rule19.asp">Joint Rule 19</a> which are hyperlinked to this tutorial.  
      </p>

      <p class="ethicsTutorial__text njIndent">
        The <a href="statutes.asp?T=COIL">Conflicts of Interest Law</a> and/or the Legislative <a href="code_ethics.asp">Code of Ethics</a> have specific application to the following general 
        areas of conduct by legislators and/or legislative employees:

      <p class="ethicsTutorial__text njIndent">Lawyer-legislators and lawyer-legislative employees should also familiarize themselves with In the Matter of Advisory Committee on Professional Ethics Opinion 621, 128 N.J. 577 (1992), with regard to their ethical standards as lawyers and public officials.</p>

      <p class="ethicsTutorial__text njIndent">
        The Legislative <a href="code_ethics.asp">Code of Ethics</a> implements the standards of the <a href="statutes.asp?T=COIL">Conflicts of Interest Law</a>; imposes additional standards of behavior with respect to involvement in casino activity by legislators, their firms or immediate families; restricts legislators in the use of their official titles; and also requires legislators to file an annual disclosure statement with respect to sources of family income and other information. Legislators must file financial disclosure statements covering the previous calendar year with the Joint Legislative Committee on 
        Ethical Standards by May 15. Legislators have a continuing obligation to report any termination or assumption of public employment by themselves or their spouses within 30 days. It should be noted that the <a href="code_ethics.asp">Code of Ethics</a> is divided into four chapters:  
        <a href="code_ethics.asp#1">Chapter 1</a> is the definition section; <a href="code_ethics.asp#2">Chapter 2</a> regulates legislators; <a href="code_ethics.asp#3">Chapter 3</a> regulates legislative staff; 
        and <a href="code_ethics.asp#4">Chapter 4</a> covers administration and enforcement. 
      </p>
      
      <p class="ethicsTutorial__text njIndent">
        The Joint Legislative Committee on Ethical Standards is currently a bipartisan committee composed of eight public members.
        The Joint Committee is responsible for administering the <a href="statutes.asp?T=COIL">Conflicts of Interest Law</a> 
        and the <a href="code_ethics.asp">Code of Ethics</a> for members of the Legislature and officers and employees in the legislative branch 
        of government.  The Joint Committee investigates, either on its own initiative or in response to a complaint, 
        possible violations of the <a href="statutes.asp?T=COIL">Law</a>, <a href="code_ethics.asp">Code</a>, or <a href="rule19.asp">Joint Rule 19</a>.  The Joint Committee is empowered to impose a fine 
        up to $10,000 or suspend from office an officer or employee of the Legislature for violating the <a href="statutes.asp?T=COIL">Law</a> or <a href="code_ethics.asp">Code</a>, and it may fine a legislator up to $10,000 and recommend disciplinary action to the legislator's House.
      </p>

      <p class="ethicsTutorial__text njIndent">
        The Joint Committee may also render formal advisory opinions to legislators and legislative officers and employees as to whether certain proposed actions would violate the <a href="statutes.asp?T=COIL">Conflicts Law</a>, <a href="code_ethics.asp">Code of Ethics</a> or 
        <a href="rule19.asp">Joint Rule 19</a>. The Legislative Counsel is secretary and counsel to the Joint Committee. Effective January 8, 2008, the position of Ethics Counsel was established. The Ethics Counsel provides confidential informal ethics advice to legislators and employees upon request, when the request is one fully answered by the New Jersey Conflicts of Interest Law or the Legislative Code of Ethics or is on a subject previously determined by the Joint Committee. The Ethics Counsel may also assist members and employees in requesting formal advisory opinions from the Joint Committee on novel subject matters. Legislators are required to consult annually with the Ethics Counsel regarding the requirements of the Conflicts Law, Code of Ethics and other ethics provisions. Legislators and staff should direct inquiries regarding the <a href="statutes.asp?T=COIL">Law</a> and the <a href="code_ethics.asp">Code</a> to the Ethics Counsel in the Office of Legislative Services (609-847-3901). 
      </p>

      <p class="ethicsTutorial__text">
        <strong>IMPORTANT NOTE:</strong> The hypothetical questions in the tutorial are designed to illustrate how some of the provisions of the <a href="statutes.asp?T=COIL">Law</a> and <a href="code_ethics.asp">Code</a> are applied to specific factual situations. Even minor factual changes could result in different responses. Legislators and legislative staff should not use this tutorial as a substitute for actual advice from the Ethics Counsel and the Joint Legislative Committee on Ethical Standards.

        <p class="modal__text"><strong>Summary: </strong>Generally these provisions restrict legislators and legislative employees from accepting compensation, rewards, employment, gifts, honoraria, or other things of value from outside sources to influence their official duties or for matters related to their official duties. Legislators and legislative employees are prohibited from accepting anything to <strong> influence </strong>them in the performance of their official duties. With regard to accepting gifts and other things of value for matters relating to official duties, the law was amended on January 14, 2004 and the ethics changes took effect on April 13, 2004. The amendments to N.J.S.A. <a href="statutes.asp?T=S13D24">52:13D-24</a> prohibit legislators and officers and employees in the legislative branch of State government from soliciting, receiving, or agreeing to solicit or receive, directly or indirectly, any compensation, reward, employment, gift, honorarium, out-of-State travel or subsistence expense or anything of value from any source other than the State for any service, advice, assistance, appearance, speech or other matter related to their official duties, except as expressly authorized in this law. The<strong> only </strong>authorized exceptions for legislators and employees to receive things in connection with their official duties from outside sources are:</p>

        <p class="modal__text njIndent">1. Reasonable fees for published books on matters within one's official duties;</p>
        <p class="modal__text njIndent">2. Reimbursement or payment of actual and reasonable expenditures for travel or subsistence and allowable entertainment expenses associated with attending an event<strong> in New Jersey</strong>, if the costs are not paid by the State;</p>
        <p class="modal__text njIndent">3. Reimbursement or payment of actual and reasonable expenditures for travel or subsistence <strong> outside New Jersey</strong>, not to exceed $500.00 per trip, if the costs are not paid by the State. The $500.00 limitation does not apply if payment is made by: (a) a nonprofit organization of which the legislator or employee is an active member as a result of membership dues paid by the State; (b) a nonprofit organization that does not contract with the State to provide goods, materials, equipment or services; or (c) any agency of the federal government or one or more states or any political subdivision of another state. Members of the Legislature are now required to obtain the approval of the presiding officer of the member's House before accepting reimbursement or payment of expenditures for travel or subsistence outside New Jersey.</p>

        <p class="modal__text">"Reasonable expenditures for travel or subsistence" is defined in the law to mean commercial travel rates directly to and from an event and food and lodging expenses which are moderate and neither elaborate nor excessive. " Allowable entertainment expenses" is defined in the law to mean the costs for a guest speaker, incidental music and other ancillary entertainment at any meal at an event, if they are not elaborate or excessive, but does not include the cost of personal recreation, such as being a spectator at or engaging in a sporting or athletic activity which may occur as part of that event.</p>
        <p class="modal__text">N.J.S.A. <a href="statutes.asp?T=S13D241">52:13D-24.1</a> is a supplement to the Conflicts of Interest Law which took effect April 13, 2004. This section restricts the receipt of things of value from lobbyists or governmental affairs agents as those terms are defined in N.J.S.A. <a href="statutes.asp?T=S13C20">52:13C-20</a>. A lobbyist is any person, business entity or other organization which uses a governmental affairs agent to influence legislation, regulation or governmental process. A governmental affairs agent is any person receiving something of value to influence legislation, regulation or governmental process by communicating with or providing benefits to, directly or indirectly, public officials, including legislators and legislative staff. Except as expressly authorized in N.J.S.A. <a href="statutes.asp?T=S13D24">52:13D-24</a> or when the lobbyist or governmental affairs agent is a member of the immediate family of the legislator or employee, no legislator or employee may accept, directly or indirectly, any compensation, reward, employment, gift, honorarium or other thing of value from a lobbyist or governmental affairs agent totaling more than $250.00 in a calendar year. It is important to note that this restriction applies even though the "thing of value" received from a lobbyist or governmental affairs agent is unrelated to one's public service. The $250.00 limit also applies to each member of the immediate family of a legislator which is defined to be a spouse, child, parent, or sibling residing in the same household.</p>
        <p class="modal__text">The above prohibition does not apply if the compensation, reward, gift, honorarium or other thing of value is received in the course of employment with a lobbyist or governmental affairs agent unrelated to one's official duties. The prohibition also does not apply if the legislator or employee makes full reimbursement to the lobbyist or governmental affairs agent of the fair market value of the compensation, reward, gift, honorarium or other thing of value within 90 days of acceptance. Fair market value is defined as the actual cost of the compensation, reward, gift, honorarium or other thing of value.</p>
